//! CheckpointExecutor spawns an active process that acts as a Consumer to
//! StateSync for newly synced checkpoints, taking these checkpoints and
//! scheduling and monitoring ther execution. Its primary goal is to allow
//! for catching up to the current checkpoint sequence number of the network
//! as quickly as possible so that a newly joined, or recovering Node can
//! participate in a timely manner. To that end, CheckpointExecutor attempts
//! to saturate the CPU with executor tasks (one per checkpoint), each of which
//! handle scheduling and awaiting checkpoint transaction execution.
//!
//! CheckpointExecutor is made recoverable in the event of Node shutdown by way of a watermark,
//! highest_executed_checkpoint, which is guaranteed to be updated sequentially in order,
//! despite checkpoints themselves potentially being executed nonsequentially and in parallel.
//! CheckpointExecutor parallelizes checkpoints of the same epoch as much as possible, and
//! handles epoch boundaries by calling to reconfig once all checkpoints of an epoch have finished
//! executing.
